# BetterCoordsByKilo
My own take at a coordinate clipboard script. I had my grievances... Credits to LVRP-BEN for the copy-to-clipboard script (js and html)

<div>
  <h3>Commands</h3>
  <p>
    /vec2 <br>
    /vec3 <br>
    /vec4
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Add 'cs' to the end to your command to copy the C# version of the coordinates! <br>Usage Example: "/vec3 cs"</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The commands are restricted by default. You can change this in the client.lua file. Just change "true" to "false" at the bottom of each RegisterCommand.<br>
    Permissions: command.vec2, command.vec3, command.vec4
  </p>
</div>
